I am a 3rd-year Honours Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Calgary. Throughout my degree, I have worked with a handful of programming languages such as Python, R, JavaScript, C, C++, and Assembly. I am also interested in and have learned about machine-learning algorithms, data visualization, full-stack web development, and source control.
